# CLI for Justd
This is a command line tool for Just D. You can see the documentation at [here](https://getjustd.com/docs/getting-started/installation).

## Usage
You need to do this in your new project directory. And make sure you have installed Tailwind CSS and React.
### Install
```bash
npx just-cli@latest init
```
### Add
After that, you can run the following command to start adding new components.
```bash
npx just-cli@latest add <component-name>
```

It will show you the difference between the current and the new component. And it will also ask you to confirm the changes.
